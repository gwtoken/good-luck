We can all somehow imagine what will happen in a year or two. But to jump over a decade - that's a different story. We have decided it would be great ,not only to collect predictions made by different futurists in one place, but also to visualize them. It\u2019s always exciting to watch \u2013 that\u2019s why we love science-fiction movies so much.<\/p>\\n<p>Secondly, it is useful to look into the future as this gives cause to think \u2013 is everything we do today right or not? Is there something we are going to regret tomorrow?<\/p>\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"What's that got to do with Kaspersky Lab?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"<p>In fact, thinking about the future is our job. We should be able to predict what threats await us tomorrow and how best to tackle them. And we, like most people, love science fiction and crave to see what is there, beyond the horizon.<\/p>\\n<p>There is a third reason. In 2017, our company will celebrate it\u2019s 20th anniversary, which is a good chance both to look back and to look forward.<\/p>\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"How does it work?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"It\u2019s Very simple. Yellow hexagons on the globe show places where cities, objects and events of the future have been visualised by somebody. White hexagons contain only predictions. You can discuss them or add your own illustration based on what you read to the site. You can illustrate a whole city in 360 format, or, for example, the equipment of the future in an ordinary format.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"Do I have to sign up?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"No. But a registered user is able not only to watch, but also to participate. And signing up, by the way, takes no time. Each user can upload two types of objects: ordinary and 360 objects. Basically, 360 objects are cities or, with a few exceptions, rooms. Also a registered user can take part in the discussion of predictions, assess works of designers and share interesting facts with friends.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"Why isn\u2019t my city on the list?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"This is a long-term project, and we can\u2019t do it all at once. But we will try to fill in the blanks. And you can help by offering your vision of the future in your home town, street, or favourite places on Earth.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"I am not futurologist. Can I make a prediction?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"Yes, we always welcome your ideas, please <a href='#\/modal\/feedback'>send them to us<\/a>. However, we reserve the right to publish only those works that pass the editorial selection. We hope you understand us - we only want to see quality content on our website.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"Why, in your version, does the equipment look different in different places in 2050? Will globalisation be a thing of the past in 2050?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"That is unlikely to happen. It\u2019s just that the future is not a rigid monolith, but rather a motley mosaic of our concepts and ideas - everyone has their own; this is why you will see diversity in different places\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"Who are the authors of forecasts?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"At the initial stage, they are professional futurists, for example, Ian Pearson, and Kaspersky Lab experts. If the author of the brief is not indicated, it means that this forecast was compiled from different sources. We look forward to your help in the future.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"Who paints the pictures?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"Similar to forecasts, they were made by professional designers initially, but we\u2019ll be glad to see your works. Join now!\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"I can\u2019t access this website from my device. Why?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"Devices with old hardware may not support the WebGL technology that underlies most of the elements of the site. We apologise for this and hope that you will be able to open Earth 2050 from another device.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"This thing on your website doesn't seem to work\u2026.\",\r\n    \"a\": \"Thank you for noticing. Write to us using the feedback form with a note \\\"mistake\\\" - we'll fix that.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"q\": \"I want to use content from your site. Can I?\",\r\n    \"a\": \"You are free to distribute the content of this website with the obligatory indication of authorship.\"\r\n  }\r\n]",
