					<span>Summary of the game</span>
					<p>Good luck official instructional video shows you step by step how the game works.</p>
					<p>In this game, the last player to buy key at the end of the countdown wins the grand prize.</p>
					<span>General rules for exclusivity</span>
					<p>An hour's break after the round ends, which allocates the bonus to each person's account, is not available to purchase key.</p>
					<p>This time allows players to regroup and get ready for the next round.</p>
					<p>For more insight into The mechanics and motivations of The game, see The Button experiment on Reddit. Good luck is essentially a lottery in which the interests of the declarer are distributed directly to the player.</p>
					<span>Game mode</span>
					<p>Key is the key of Good luck. You buy key directly through the contract, which will affect the performance of this round and decide when and how the game ends.</p>
					<p>Built-in countdown to the game. Every time a key is sold, the amount of time is increased, and the latest player to buy the key becomes the leader.</p>
					<p>In this round, all bonuses will be paid according to key immediately, which means that as long as someone keeps buying key until the game ends, you will continue to receive passive income.</p>
					<p>As the round goes on, the key price will slowly rise (the price of key will be determined by the final prize pool price). Every key will bring you a bonus. A successful prediction of how much money will be in the pool when someone eventually wins can also bring you a decent amount of EOS revenue.</p>
					<p>The last player to buy at least one key before the timer goes to zero will immediately drain half the prize pool and close the game. (once the Game is over, the rest of the prize money will be distributed immediately to other players, WGC holders, community contributors, and other World Game Chian players.)</p>
					<span>Good luck</span>
					<p>Regular Good luck is the flagship game mode designed to last days, weeks or even months.</p>
					<p>There was no iCO time at the start of the round.</p>
					<p>There is a limit of up to 100EOS per address before the contract reaches 10,000 EOS.</p>
					<p>Key prices are rising very slowly, and each purchase will only raise prices a bit.</p>
					<p>Each key sold adds 30 seconds to the timer, capped at 24 hours.</p>
					<p>Each key will add 30 seconds, and the decimal point will be eliminated unconditionally. So 2.5 = 60 seconds</p>
					<p>No. 50, no. 20 and no. 1 buy key at the same price.</p>
					<p class="circle">Each round will be followed by a 1 hour break during which key cannot be purchased.</p>
					<span>Team</span>
					<p>In Good luck, the team is an important participating institution, which will act as the Game node, and the profits of each Game participant are closely related to the team Chian ecological group of players can not only obtain WGC make contribution, can also according to the number of WGC get TOKEN dividend and team share out bonus, share out bonus to all the EOS here.

					<span>Players win:</span>
					<p>When the player is the last to buy the key, with a countdown of 00.00, the game will end and the player will receive a 40 percent dividend.</p>
					<span>The WGC dividends</span>
					<p>1. After getting WGC, the more token accounts you have, the more dividends you will get.</p>
					<p>2. At the end of each round, all WGC holders will follow the WGC holding score red.</p>
					<h4>For more information on WGC, see our beginner's guide.</h4>
					<span>The team won the prize</span>
					<p>If a player wins the game, his or her team members will participate in the team bonus share. The proportion of bonus share of each team member will be determined according to the WGC's possession. In simple terms, the more the team members hold WGC, the higher the proportion of bonus share they win.</p>
					<span>Random drop</span>
					<p>When you buy a key on the purchase page, you may notice a line that reminds you of the chance of receiving an airdrop. For example, that line might say, "five percent chance of getting 100 EOS airdrops for next purchase!" For all EOS entering the game, 1 percent will go into the associate bonus pool. Every time you buy a key there is a chance that you will receive an airdrop from the associate bonus pool in your account. The overall probability of receiving an airdrop starts at 0%, with EOS rising by %0.1 for each additional sales order above 0.01 key.<br />(note that if you get an airdrop, you will receive the EOS directly in the game account, not the key.)<br />Once your purchase is completed on the blockchain and is eligible, you will be notified of an increase in the airdrop multiplier.<br />If you win the airdrop, how much money you get depends on how much money you put in:<br />Buy 10-100 EOS and you win 25 percent of the associate prize pool prize.<br />Purchase 100-1000 eos and you win 50% of the pool bonus.<br />Purchase above 1,000 eos and you win 75% of the associate pool prize money.<br />Note that you have to compete with other players to win the airdrop. Once a player wins the airdrop, everyone's chance will go to zero!</p>
					<span>Noun explanation</span>
					<p>Good luck USES many interesting English words as part of the game. To reduce confusion, here's the definition: Private keys - the "tickets" you buy in the game, and each time you buy a key, you qualify for the win until someone buys another key. The more keys you have, the more money you will receive from the lottery pool at the end of the round. Note that key doesn't really exist, making them "tickets" to the round. Airdrop - this is your chance to directly win some free EOS! Every time you buy a key, you have a chance to win the airdrop. The airdrop pool grows steadily in each round.</p>
					<span>The ecological system</span>
					<p>World Game Chian USES the principle of reasonable allocation of funds as the project guide, and puts the funds from the sale of WGC into its Game projects in accordance with the minimum standard of no less than 50%, so that the amount of funds in the Game is guaranteed permanently, thus making WGC a truly valuable currency.<br />We have a set of reasonable recovery mechanism of WGC, every time the players use WGC share out bonus, we will charge the poundage of 10%, the recovery of the proceeds of the WGC sell again, and again the proceeds into the future more game. Ensure internal well-funded game, if you are our loyal users and we believe that our future, so advice to you is hold firmly in the hands of the WGC, it will only become more and more valuable.<br />These contracts will be written to intelligence, the smart contracts is that we used as World Game Chian ecological bridge between the layers, it also makes the World Game Chian with all other areas across the chain system is different, it is at the premise of the birth of block chain DAPPS landing system, on the basis of guarantee the currency's value by giving supporters maximum of share out bonus, each WGC is a right of share out bonus, please cherish!</p>
